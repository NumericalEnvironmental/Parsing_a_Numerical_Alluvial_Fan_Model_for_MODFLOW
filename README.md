# Parsing_a_Numerical_Alluvial_Fan_Model_for_MODFLOW

![Preview](https://numericalenvironmental.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/grid_sections.jpg)

This Python script parses the output of a simulated alluvial fan formation model into layers to support construction of a MODFLOW model for groundwater flow through the fan. The fan formation model itself can be found at https://github.com/NumericalEnvironmental/Alluvial_fan_formation_simulator. Layer elevations and posited hydraulic conductivity values (as inferred from modeled sediment textural class distributions) are developed for every cell and written to text-delimited output files. The script is written in Python 2.7, but with the from_future module included to provide compatibility with Python 3. The Pandas library is a required.

Additional discussion, and example output, is provided on my blog: https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/a-python-script-to-support-a-modflow-model-for-a-synthetic-alluvial-fan/.

UPDATE (2-20-2018): I've modified the script to write files to supporting running PHAST reactive transport simulations, in addition to MODFLOW. See my blog entry for additional details: https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/extension-of-a-synthetic-alluvial-fan-parsing-script-to-support-a-phast-groundwater-chemical-transport-model/.

The following input files are required:

* sed_distribution.csv - the raw comma-delimited text files generated by the alluvial fan simulator
* model_params,txt - a file containing a short list of constraints (e.g., number of layers, maximum elevation clipping value, number of bins for digitizing mineralogy distribution) for gridding
* sed_props.txt - a file containing the names of textural classes of the simulated alluvial sediments, along with their corresponding user-provided hydraulic conductivities.

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the code useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
